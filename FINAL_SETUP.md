service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /notes/{noteId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **"Publish"**

### 2. Test Your App
